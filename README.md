# ng2-movable

Demo: [https://spali.github.io/ng2-movable/](https://spali.github.io/ng2-movable/)

__Features__
-   Optionally enable and disable functionality by `movableEnabled` attribute binding.
-   Optionally specify an element (directive `movableHandle`) which is responsible for moving another element (directive `movable`).
-   Supports nesting of multiple movables.
-   Support for detailed styling of movable and handle element by classes depending on the states.
-   by default won't left the visible viewport (can be disabled by setting `movableConstrained` to `false`).
-   support to be constrained to an element which the movable can't leave by setting `movableConstraint` to the id of the element.
-   by default movable uses `relative` positioning if nothing else or `static` is specified. This can be overriden by css to anything else (except `static`). For `fixed` and `absolute` you have to pay attention for the initial positioning, especially if you have constrained the movable to an element, you have to make sure the initial position is within the element the movable is constrained to.
